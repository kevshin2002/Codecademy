Introduction:
The command line is a text interface for our computer.
It's a program that takes in commands and passes them on to the computer's operating system to run.

From the command line, we can navigate through files and folders on our computer just like a file explorer.
The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.

The advantage of using the command line is its power.
We can run programs, write scripts to automate common tasks, and combine simple commands to handle difficult tasks.
All of these traits make it an important programming tool.

This course is for unix-based systems such as Linux and Mac OS x.

Filesystem:
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure:
The first directory in the filesystem is the root directory. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem.
Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.
Each directory can contain more files and child directories. The parent-child relationship continues as long as directories and files are nested.
