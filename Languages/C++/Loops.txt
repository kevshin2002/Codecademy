Introduction to Loops:
A loop is a programming tool that repeats some code or a set of instructions until a specified condition is reached.
There are two types of loops:
white loops and for loops.

While loops:
While loops will continue to execute until the condition is true.
Example:
while (condition) {
	statement
}

For Loop:
When we know exactly how many times we want to iterate, we can use a for loop instead of a while loop.
Example:
for ( int i = 0; i < 20; i ++)
{
	statement
}
The initialization of a counter: int i = 0;
The continue condition: i <20
The charge in the counter or incrementation: i++;

Review:
Loops perform repetitive actions so we don't have to code those actions manually every time.
