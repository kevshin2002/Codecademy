Introduction to Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions.
They allow programs to make more flexible decisions.
The result of the operation of a logical operator is a bool value of either true or false.
There are three logical operators:
&& - the and logical operator
|| - the or logical operator
! - the not logical operator.

Logical Operator: &&
The and logical operator is denoted by && and returns true if the condition on the left and the right are both true. Otherwise, it returns false.
Note: The keyword and can also be used in the place of &&.

Logical Operator: ||
The or logical operator is denoted by || and returns true when the condition on the left is true or the condition on the right is true.
We only need one of them to be true.
Note: The keyword or can also be used in the place of ||.

Logical Operator: !
The not logical operator is denoted by !.

It reverses the bool outcome of the expression that immediately follows.
Note: the keyword not can be used in the place of !.

Review:
&& - the and operator
|| - the or logical operator
! - the not logical operator
