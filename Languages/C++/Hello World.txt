Introduction to C++:
C++ is a programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup and his team at Bell Laboratories in 1979.
We can find C++ applications everywhere as it's one of the most widely used languages in the world;

C++ was derived from the C language and Bjarne's goal was to add object-oriented programming into C, a language well respected for its portability and low-level functionality.

Benefits to learn C++:
It's fast and flexible
It's well-supported
It forces us to think in new and creative ways

Hello World:
C++ programs are stored in files which usually have the file extension .cpp, which simpyl stands for "C Plus Plus"

Output:
C++, like most programming languages, runs line by line, from top to bottom.
The structure of a C++ program:

include libraries (at the top)
the main() function (where the program does)
end of main (end of program)

Code Example:
std::cout << "Hello World!\n";

std::cout is the "character output stream". 
<< is an operator that comes right after it.
"Hello World!\n" is what's being outputted here. The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.
; is a punctuation that tells the computer that we're at the end of a statement.

Extra Information:
C++ is a case-sensitive language, which means that keywords and variable declarations must match the case.
A comment is indicated by //
#include <iostream>, this is known as a pre-processor directive. It instructs the compiler to locate the file that contains code for a library known as iostream.
This library contains code that allows for input and output, such as displaying data in the terminal window or reading input from our keyboard.
C++ programs permit judicious use of white space (tabs, spaces, newlines) to create code that is easier to read.

Review:
C++ is a general-purpose coding language
C++ runs line by line, from top to bottom.
std::cout is how we output to the terminal.
